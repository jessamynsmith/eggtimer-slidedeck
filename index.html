      #Why track menstruation?

      * Self-acceptance
      * Self-knowledge
      * Data is fun!
      * Health
      * Planning
      * Self-management/self-care

      <img src="framework/img/workshop/feel_no_shame.png" alt="Feel No Shame">

      <p class="presenter-notes">
        Let’s go all the way back to the 80s, when I was growing up in a hippie community. Raised to
        be a feminist, try to dispel shame about women’s bodies. I started early (11) and was
        decidedly unhappy about it, though tracking it on a calendar mollified me slightly.
        Self-acceptance (dispel shame). Self-knowledge (patterns). Health (changes over time,
        affects various conditions). Data is fun! (graphs!!) Planning (vacation, job interview,
        date). Self-management (extra self-care if needed, bike accidents). My cycle has always
        affected me strongly.

      #Why online menstrual tracking?

      * Email notifications
      * Access from multiple locations
      * Electronic data

           alt="eggtimer notification email">

      <p class="presenter-notes">
        I had a lifetime of data on paper calendars, but this was hard to work with. Something as
        simple as calculating my average cycle length was laborious. By this time I was an
        experienced web developer, and when you’re really familiar with hammers… There wasn’t much
        online in the early 2000s, but I found http://www.mymonthlycycles.com/ and I went with it.
        It had the critical features I needed: calendar that allowed you to enter menstrual events,
        prediction of next ovulation and period, and email reminders. Customized to say "red alert!"

      #Why eggtimer? (technical)

      * Data ownership and export (API!)
      * Statistics and graphs
      * Longer-term predictions
      * Neutral interface and notifications
      * Mobile-friendly
      * Marketing-free

      <p class="presenter-notes">
        As time went on, I got increasingly nervous about having 10+ years of data in a web app with
        no way to export it. It was 2012, and emboldened by the success of talkbackbot (my first
        open source project), I decided to start my long-time dream of creating my own menstrual
        tracker app with the features I’d always wanted. I was curious about the distribution of
        cycle lengths and other statistics, and I wanted graphs! I also wanted to see at least 3
        future cycles, with predicted ovulation and start date. Finally, I could do without the
        flowing pink/purple script, the emphasis on getting pregnant, and the ads.

      #Why eggtimer? (sociopolitical)

      * Normalize menstruation

      * Conversation starter

      <img src="framework/img/workshop/django_irc_logs.png" alt="Django IRC logs about eggtimer">

      <p class="presenter-notes">
        Gives me a chance to talk about menstruation on a regular basis, in places it wouldn't
        normally come up. It’s amazing how many men have simply never thought of it and are
        surprised that anyone would want such a thing. I love using it to teach software
        development, to men and women, for different reasons. I like simply sending men examples out
        of the app and seeing if they catch on, and I like sending women examples from the app as a
        show of solidarity.

      #Why Django?

      * Friendly community<br>(#django, meetups, conferences, etc.)
      * (Relatively) easy-to-use framework
      * Built-in user management
      * Excellent ORM
      * Great packages available<br>(e.g. registration, API)

      <p class="presenter-notes">
        I was still relatively new to the Django community when I started this project, and I was
        very touched by the welcome I’d received. I was finding the framework easy to pick up and
        work with. I was impressed by how most of the time when I needed some functionality not
        built into Django, there was an existing package. When I first started I was using
        django-registration and tastypie, now django-allauth and django-rest-framework.

        Did a lot of research, choices have evolved over time. FullCalendar was pretty new back then
        and has developed well over the years. Bootstrap was added later, to make the app
        mobile-friendly. (Don’t fight your framework!) Originally I was using D3 but transitioned to
        Highcharts for ease of use.

        I use the web version on my phone and it works pretty well, so I haven’t been working much

        getting it on the app store. Times have changed: when I started this project there was
        nothing like it available. Now there are a number of apps I hear good things about.

      #Future considerations

      * Menstrual tracker: an idea whose time had come
      * Who do you trust with your data?
      
      <img src="framework/img/workshop/eggtimer_account.png" alt="eggtimer account page">

      <p class="presenter-notes">
        When I started building eggtimer, there was nothing on the market that was even close to
        what I wanted. There are now many apps, and some seem pretty good. At the time I wasn't
        comfortable pursuing eggtimer as a startup, but it was clearly a timely idea. I am very glad
        that this market is now being served. I keep working on eggtimer mostly for personal
        satisfaction, at this point. It still has a few features that as far as I know nobody else
        has implemented.

        Trust: how do you know companies won't use your data against you, or leak it? I trust
        myself (mostly), but why would others trust me?

      #Reflections

      * Professional growth: isolated -> open source community
      * Personal growth: frightened woman -> confident woman
      * Appreciation for my cycle
      * Vision >> profession: Technology by and for EVERYONE

      <p class="presenter-notes">
        Building eggtimer was part of my overall life growth process in multiple ways. 
        Talkbackbot was my initial foray into open
        source, and gave me the courage to start eggtimer, a much more ambitious project. This in
        turn brought me more fully into the open source community, and I felt confident enough to
        try contributing to other projects. I spent my early years in software feeling very
        vulnerable due to my gender, and I don't feel that way anymore.

        At the personal level, a lifetime of tracking my cycles has helped me develop more
        appreciation of my body and my self as a woman. For many years I was mostly frustrated by
        my cycles. I really only liked the outward, analytical ovulatory phase and suffered through
        the inward, sensitive pre-menstrual/menstrual phase. When I
        started studying reiki, craniosacral, and qigong, I gained new appreciation for the latter
        phase, as my increased sensitivity makes me more effective.

        The personal is inevitably political, and eggtimer is aligned with my ultimate vision of
        self-expression, equality, and access to resources for everyone the world. In the
        professional realm, that vision expresses itself as: technology that serves everyone's
        needs, where everyone can participate in the creation process.

        My commitment to diversity in and access to technology is why I built Ziversity.com, a
        diversity recruiting platform. And yes, it is a Django app! I am currently the Interim CTO,
        and we are looking for someone to replace me so I can get back to full-time
        codementoring. As a perk, if you sign up you get to have me as a mentor!
